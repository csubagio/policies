Your privacy is very important to me. 

The Alexa skill you've enabled will by nature of its operation collect voice information you speak to it, in order figure out what you've said. See your general Alexa privacy policy for information on how that is stored and used. This skill does not have any direct access to your voice recording.

The skill cannot collect any information that can identify you, but using an obfuscated ID provided by Amazon will record your options and additional gameplay outcomes like scores, in the cloud. This information will be destroyed when you disable the skill, in accordance with the GDPR "Right to be Forgotten".

The skill will also collect entirely anonymized information, for example the number of times it has been played, the number of times the AI wins, and other similar performance metrics. This information is aggregated for statistical analysis in order to improve the skill, and cannot be traced back to you.
